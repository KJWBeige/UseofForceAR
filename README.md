GAME NAME:  	Use of Force AR

DESCRIPTION:	Use of Force is designed to both show a use-case of augmented reality (AR) and the need for more training in our nations police academies, security details, and understanding of rules of engagement.  Especially given differences in background and social dynamics.

RULES:  The display will show three different types of citizens:  Gun Weilding, Hostile/Aggressive, Scared/Passive.  And the three correct responses award one point per player.  Correct responses correspond to: shoot, tase and pass.  

CONTROLS:	Use arrow keys.  
Left = Shoot
Down = Tase
Right = Pass

PLAYERS:	Two player game.  First player inputs name, Second player inputs name. To start, click HERE with mouse.  Then first player has 10 seconds, and switches to second player.

CODE USED:  HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery

IF MORE TIME:  Would make the game much more dynamic by comparing "rounds" of play, more varied citizen types that warrant different responses, and of course application to mobile devices for true AR effect.
